> Iggy Syntax

This is just a quick syntax theme I came up with, based on One Light.
Ideally this one will evolve into something nicer and more mature,
there's still a lot of things that need fixing like: spacing, underlines & overlays.

Additionally I will create heavily monochromatic version of it, because right
now there's too much colors for my taste :)
